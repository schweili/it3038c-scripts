This is the README.md file for my Final Project (continuation of my frist project)

The script I developed was written in python and its purpose is to display all the storage drives on your computer and tell you information about the storage space on those drives.

My script does not reqiure any input from the user, all that is needed to run the script is powershell.

Running the script on your computer should display all the current drives you have on your computer and will provide information on how much space is on the drive and how much storage you have used.
